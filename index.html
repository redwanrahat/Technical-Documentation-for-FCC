                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                            can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="line-break">
                            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a
                            core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                            JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                            objects; for example:
                        </p>
                        <p class="line-break">
                            <ul>
                                <li class="line-break">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
                                    respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>

                                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity
                                    of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                                    manipulations on a server.</li>

                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
                            The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
                            type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.

                            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
                            properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed. </p>
